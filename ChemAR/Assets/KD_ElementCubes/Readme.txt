Thank you for purchasing the "Science Lab - Mortar and Pestle" pack from KittandaDesign

This is a simple asset pack that contains 118 prefabs from a mesh created by me. 

I have set up the prefabs in the Prefab folder for you to drag and drop into your scenes. 
Each Prefab is named EC(element number)_(element name) for easier searching. For example "EC1_Hydrogen"

There is a high res reflection probe set up in the example scene that might slow things down, so just disable it. I used it for the higher res promo video. 

Model
-----
The center cube of the model is 1m x 1m, so take that into consideration when placing the prefabs in your scene for rescaling.

UVs are unwrapped.

Pivot is centered.

Textures
--------

118 Texture sets were made using a PBR workflow. 
I have set up the materials for the prefabs using a Standard Specular setup using the maps:
Albedo, AO, Emission, Normal, Specular
There are also the maps for: Basecolor, Metallic, Roughness, if you want to set up differently

Scripts
-------

I wrote a Controller Script for the experience called "ExampleSceneController" and is used to run the example scene. All it does is rotate the center display area if there is a object to display and houses a number of Arrays that you can populate with things you want to display. Feel free to use this code and the objects I have added to the scene for your own work if you choose. 

If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me as I am always happy to create more materials for my 
models or work on commissions!

Hope you have a great day further!
Gerrit
